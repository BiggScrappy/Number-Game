# 🎯 Number Guess Game

A simple command-line number guessing game written in Python. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess the correct number. Feedback is given after each guess until the user wins.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Git** – Version control and collaboration

## 🕹️ How It Works

1. The program selects a random number between **1 and 100**.
2. The user is prompted to **enter a guess**.
3. After each guess:
   - If correct → `"You win!"`
   - If incorrect → `"Incorrect guess, try again."`
4. The loop continues until the user guesses correctly.
